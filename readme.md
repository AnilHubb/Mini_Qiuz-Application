  - A title, question display area, answer buttons, and the "Next" button.

### 2. **CSS** (`styles.css`)
- Styles the layout, buttons, colors for correct/incorrect answers, and hover effects.

### 3. **JavaScript** (`script.js`)
- Defines an array of questions with possible answers and correct flags.
- Controls quiz flow using functions:
  - `startQuiz()` – Initializes the quiz.
  - `showQuestion()` – Displays each question and answers.
  - `selectAnswer()` – Handles answer selection and validation.
